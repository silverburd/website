# Publications Data File
# Description
#     This file contains individual records for each publication published by
#     members of the group in BibTeX format
#     Feel free to use an existing record as a starting point for a new entry.
#     In addition to the standard BibTeX fields, the following attributes are
#     available for each record:
#         project     Specifying this will list the document under the appropriate
#                       project. Entry must match to the "shortname" attribute
#                       of the project.*
#      * Required in order for the website to display
#    IMPORTANT NOTES:
#      - "year" entry should NOT contain any text.
#      - Bib keys should be unique. Search for duplicates before adding new
#        entries.
#      - "month" entry should be a three-letter abbreviation without a dot, and
#            not inside braces, e.g., month = apr
#      - "doi" is preferred. It can be either the doi identifier or the complete
#            doi link. Use "link" field if doi/doi link is not available.
